**user - authentication types**

## 1. knowledge-based authentication

###### verifying user's identities based on whether or not they know something. ex a password, a pin, security question etc.

### problems reliant on strength of password

## 2. Ownership-based authentication

###### verifying user's identities based on whether or not they have something. ex. otp system, authenticator apps or otp fob etc.

### problems rely indirectly on knowledge based strategies, loss of devices pose a big threat

## 3 => Biological-based authentication

##### verifying user's identities based on hard to fake biological characteristics. ex facial re4cognition, iris scan, fingerprint etc.

### problems rely directly on physical hardware devices.

# Two factor authentication makes use of knowledge based and ownership based authentication.
